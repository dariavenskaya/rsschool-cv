## About Myself


I was born in Misk, Belarus in 1998. Was studying in Minsk Lyceum #1, after that entered Minsk State Linguistic University, but quit after the second semester due to my working graphic. After working in several coffee-shops I started my own business in HORECA. Owning a coffee-shop for almost 3 years let me manage my own time and work. I became proficient in time-management, management and staff training.

 A couple of mounths ago I became interested in digital, started to study Quality Assurance, testing and design, but couldn't find my own direction. Ocassionaly I found JS, HTML and CSS exercises. It was fun and made me want to learn about Front-end and Front-end Developer profession. It inspired me a lot, and I started to look for an efficient way to study. And then I found JS/Front-end RS-School courses and am currently studying.
